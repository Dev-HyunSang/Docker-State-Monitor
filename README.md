## üß≠ Setting UP

### Setting up Prometheus
To set Prometheus, you can set it through `prometheus.yml`.  
You can configure basic Prometheus and Prometheus Node Exporter as shown below.

```yml
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'Node-exporter'

    scrape_interval: 10s

    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```
